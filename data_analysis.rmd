## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
heights <- c(72, 83, 49, 92, 100)
ave_height <- mean(heights)
sd_height <-sd(heights)
```
In our study, we measured the heights of `r length(heights)` individuals. Their average height was `r ave_height` (sd= `r sd_height`). These remarkable findings show potential for further study.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

P.S. rsqrt(3) =`r sqrt(3)`
